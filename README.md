# dwm
My Personal files for dwm. I have this in my home dir. By default, terminal is 'termite' and run launcher is 'dmenu'. 

My dmenu is also from suckless.org (not arch wiki)

Current patches: attachaside, actualfullscreen, movestack, gridmode, uselessgaps

INSTALL:

Have 'dmenu'

Have 'termite' (not required, can just find your terminal in dmenu)

Have 'nitrogen' and use it to set wallpaper

Go into the dwm folder (might be 'dwm/dwm') and 'sudo make clean install'

Put 'autostart.sh' into the .dwm folder and 'sudo chmod a+x autostart.sh' to have wallpaper.
